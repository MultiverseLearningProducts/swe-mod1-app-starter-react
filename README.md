#PlantShed E-commerce (Judith,Afreen,Ricardo,Mushfika)

# Description of our Project:
PlantShed is one of the most popular plantstores in NYC. Not only do they sell a wide variety of houseplants and flowers, they have a local coffeeshop where customers can enjoy a fresh brew before shopping. PlantShed expanded into the e-commerce space, where customers can view the inventory of plants, flowers, and coffeebeans and shop from home.
